# Scraped-navodesk-website
To scrape all data from it I used Scrapy which is a module of python.

(i) Extract_data_navodesk.py: This file simply extracts all the content of a website.
(ii) Extract_html_code: This file extracts the all product's HTML code and saved the HTML file of it with the name CURRENT_DATE_TIME_SKU_NO.

There are two output files

(i) Extract_data_output.csv: The output file where Scrapped data of Extract_data_navodesk.py were saved.
(ii) HTML CODES: In this folder all the HTML codes of products are present.
